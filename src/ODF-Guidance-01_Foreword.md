# Foreword

The present document in its initial release doesn't bring anything more, in terms of content, to the original UK guidance acknowledged below. 

The need of a fork was mainly meant to render the document in a textual format (Pandoc's Markdown) in order to be able to store it onto a public repository (GitHub) and easily keep track of versions and changes.
The original guidance is available in HTML format only, accessible by means of copy and paste from the UK Government web pages. 

I thought the document had to be a general guidance for any government interested in adopting ODF as the world's leading open document standard. 

Generalizing it, rendering it into Markdown and committing it onto GitHub will allow people to join the effort to keep it up-to-date, correct typos, add new content and easily fork it e.g. for translation purposes or any other purpose.

For converting the source of this document from Markdown format into other formats (in particular ODF), I suggest [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/), a universal free software document converter available under the GPLv3 license.
