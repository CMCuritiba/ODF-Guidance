# Overview of productivity software
A non-exhaustive list of productivity solutions that allow you to work with ODF, including product features and other important details.

## Auxiliary products and services
After assessing the needs of your users, you'll understand what functionality your organisation and audiences require from office document handling solutions.

A variety of applications work with ODF 1.2 out of the box. You also might be able to continue using an existing application by using a plugin, add-on or extension.

Open source solutions allow cost-effective customisation to your organisation's needs. The sooner your organisation moves to support the ODF 1.2 standard, the better able you are to find the best-value solutions for your needs.

This chapter is a non-exhaustive list of productivity solutions that allow you to work with Open Document Format (ODF). Other solutions that could be relevant include:

- web viewers (eg [ViewerJS](http://viewerjs.org/) ) that allow you to make documents accessible on your website
- software libraries that allow automated document access (eg Apache ODF Toolkit)
- metadata removal software, eg:
    - [Datadistiller](http://www.digitalconfidence.com/DataDistiller-Metadata-Removal-Engine.html) 
    - [MetaClean](http://www.adarsus.com/en/metaclean.html)
    - [Metadata Assistant](http://www.thepaynegroup.com/support/faq/metadata/)
    - Detailed discussion of such auxiliary products, projects and services is out of scope of this document.

It's produced with the support of the KDE technology team, one of the largest open source developer communities in the world. Calligra is very modular and is built around the open source Calligra Office Engine, which contains many freely reusable components.
