title: 'Open Document Format (ODF)'
subtitle: 'A Guidance for Governments'
author: Paolo Dongilli - Autonomous Province of Bozen-Bolzano
date: v0.1 - 28 October 2015
abstract: The UK government has selected ODF 1.2 as the standard for editable office documents to be used across government. ODF 1.2 was selected as the standard for government because it (a) allows citizens, businesses and other organisations to share and edit documents with government - and the other way round (b) allows people working in government to share and edit documents with each other (c) is compatible with a wide range of software (d) is a reliable long-term solution for storing and accessing information. This slightly modified version of the original guidance, gives general information on the standard, as well as more detailed information for chief technology officers and procurement officers of all governments that want to avoid lock-in by using the world's leading open document standard.
